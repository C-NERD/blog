     On
     <code>
      Saturday 15th of April 2023
     </code>
     I hosted and moderated a debate on a medical bill proposed by the nigerian house of rep member
     <code>
      Hon Ganiyu Johnson
     </code>
     . This bill also known as the
     <code>
      Brain drain
     </code>
     bill aims to mandate any Nigeria trained Medical or Dental Practitioner to Practice in Nigeria for a minimum of five years before granted a full licence by the council in order to make quality health services available to Nigeria.
